**Glorious Era** is a modpack that transforms your Vanilla experience from the new versions to the Beta versions of Minecraft. The aim is to allow you to play by adding other mods on top, without having to remove features from the new versions.

In addition to the experience, the modpack is designed to be as light as possible and optimized to run on older devices. A minimum of 512mb of ram memory is necessary to play!
